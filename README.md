## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br>
Here is the old link to [2020 Optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/)

<br>



## I am a data scientist working @IBM.

In 2023 and 2024 I was doing mainly genAI projects with watsonx.ai (IBM's vessel for LLMs). Most projects were about bots and RAG apps, some about creating reports from tabular data, and about searching in large patent databases.

For me personally 2025 is the year of AI agents. I was fascinated with idea of AI agents for many years, giving public speaches and engaging in early projects. For example I have engaged and popularized the idea on AI Alignment through Pacman game. IBM Research made the reinforcemnet learning agent to play & win the game of Pacman but [without killing the ghosts](https://www.fastcompany.com/90255740/ibm-explores-the-intersection-of-ai-ethics-and-pac-man)



## My interests before genAI era :


   * ### Machine Learning & Data Governance
   I engage in my projects as [an ML Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/6d6d21e9-eec4-463b-8f22-22d409103563), or as [a Data Scientist](https://www.credly.com/badges/4c421bd9-e323-4fb4-a8be-45cae51e85af). See the notes about [my latest ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/) as example. In this project I have used tweedie regressor with transformers to count pure premium for insurance product. Model and transformer were hosted on Watson Machine Learning and they used Watson OpenScale monitors to scan bias, explainability, fairness and drift.
   
   * ### Natural Language Processing
   Currently I am building MVP in area of social listening case, scrapping the content from social platforms, analysing it with  [python libraries](https://www.ibm.com/natural-language-processing) and translating the insights into business value. I am also using Large Language Models from Huggingface, and from IBM [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx).
   
   * ### Optimization
   Please see my two [Decision Optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/) that I made for my clients. Decision Optimization (aka prescriptive analytics) is a great way to enrich machine learning projects.
   For optimization projects I am using CPLEX, and DOcplex, two IBM libraries that can help build our dynamic programming models efficiently.
   
   * ### Visual Recognition
   Using Detectron framework on IBM platfrom named Maximo Visual Inspection I have created a model where client's AGV carts were inspected for security, giving great value of automated daily security checks. Watch [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keC8Tnj8OJ8&ab_channel=IBMDeveloper) for more information. 
   
   * ### Neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school like [this one](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events/ns-summerschool2022/). Neural-symbolic AI is kind of deductive system allowing you to put a reasoning layer on top of your neural nets.
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   If you want the hands on experience, take all activities needed to get [this badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent a summer (and few consecutive months) learning about [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), brilliant Python SDK for quantum programming. I have contributed to Qiskit in many ways, attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be), and enjoyed being the part of the community. I am glad IBM is making such risky bets. Google's Larry Page famously said: "Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."
