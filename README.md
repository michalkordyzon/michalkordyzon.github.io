## Hi there 👋
<br>
<br>

## I am a data scientist working @IBM

## genAI related projects
Starting in end of 2022 the ear of genAI started, this technology  spread rapidly and new breakthroughs appeared almost weekly. Since then, I've been working mainly on genAI projects using open-source and proprietary watsonx.ai (IBM’s platform for LLMs). These projects focused on RAG applications, automated report generation (from both tabular data and documents), and “intelligent” search.

2025 is shaping up to be the year of AI agents. For me it's importnat. Not only because of their business value, but also as a personal milestone. I’ve been fascinated by agentic AI since 2017, giving public talks and joining early projects, though I still viewed it as a distant future. One example I often used to trigger semi-futuristic, semi-technical discussions was an IBM Research project where an AI agent played Pac-Man. The special thing was that AI agent played 'ethically' and avoided 'killing' ghosts (the reward function in reinfocement learning). Here is the link: [ethical Pacman](https://www.fastcompany.com/90255740/ibm-explores-the-intersection-of-ai-ethics-and-pac-man).


## ML related projects

   * ### Machine Learning & Data Governance
   I have engaged in many projects as [an ML Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/6d6d21e9-eec4-463b-8f22-22d409103563), or as [a Data Scientist](https://www.credly.com/badges/4c421bd9-e323-4fb4-a8be-45cae51e85af). See the notes about [one interesting ML project](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watson_insurance/) as example. I have used theere a tweedie regressor with transformers to count pure premiums for insurance product. Model and transformer were hosted on Watson Machine Learning and they used Watson OpenScale monitors to scan bias, explainability, fairness and drift.
   
   * ### Natural Language Processing
   I have built Miniman Viable Products using NLP, as an exaample, one case was about social listening: scrapping & analysis of social content using [python libraries](https://www.ibm.com/natural-language-processing) and translating the insights into business value.
   
   * ### Optimization
   See my two [Decision Optimization workshops](https://michalkordyzon.github.io/watsonjam/), I've made them for clients starting to use IBM Decision Optimization (aka prescriptive analytics). It's a great way to enrich machine learning projects, and funny thing is that so few client even know about it.
   For optimization projects I am using CPLEX, and DOcplex, two IBM libraries that can help build our dynamic programming models efficiently.
   
   * ### Visual Recognition
   Using Detectron, Yolo and FAster R-CNN I delivered value in many visual recognition projects. The platform for this was Maximo Visual Inspection. As example, I was creating a model for one client where AGV carts were inspected for security by the model, which saved time on and gave high accuracy comparing to human inspection. The movie made after project completion is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keC8Tnj8OJ8&ab_channel=IBMDeveloper). 
   
   * ### Neuro-symbolic AI
   It's always beneficial to attend a good summer school like [this one](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/events/ns-summerschool2022/). Neural-symbolic AI is kind of deductive system allowing you to put a reasoning layer on top of your neural nets.
   You will find general info about neural-symbolic AI [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/). 
   If you want the hands on experience, take all activities needed to get [this badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/a9c7f8c5-5d62-4437-aa57-977f779b21d5/linked_in?t=rh42yg).
   * ### Qiskit
   In 2020 I have spent a summer (and few consecutive months) learning about [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), great Python SDK for quantum programming. I have contributed to Qiskit in many ways, attended [hackathons](https://www.credly.com/badges/7e4653bd-141a-4280-8544-f345fb7232be), and enjoyed being the part of the community. I am glad IBM is making such risky bets. Google's Larry Page famously said: "Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."


   * ### Sysem z
   As engineer I have grown from IBM Z platform, the most stable, reliable and long-lived server platform on the planet. IBM Z is unique and very attractive for both technical folks and the bussiness, it's like Warren Buffett of engineering. I had a priviledge to co-author z14 servers IBM Redbooks documentation in 2018. IBM Z prefers: reliability over hype, investment continuity over price wars and technology unexpected 'End of Marketing', quality over 'nice features'.
